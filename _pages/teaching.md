Whether one is a freshman taking their first introductory statistics course or a tenured statistics professor
with countless publications and citations, statistics is hard! This is because statistics is inherently trying
to solve a nearly impossible problem: using a relatively minuscule amount of data to make predictions and
inferences about an entire population. The nature of this challenge leads to an unsettling fact about the
field. That is, unlike other fields that may produce clear and deterministic results, statistics lives in the
gray. It is a discipline grounded in uncertainty, where most answers carry some level of doubt. My teaching
philosophy embraces this grayness and recognizes that learning is not about perfection but about pushing
the mind to engage with unfamiliar ideas.
