## Welcome!
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Statistical Science and Teacher of Record at Baylor University.  My primary research focuses on developing [*sufficient dimension reduction*](https://deriktboonstra.github.io/research/#sufficient-dimension-reduction) methodologies for high-dimensional data analysis with applications in  genomics, econometrics, and finance.  Moreover, I have introduced an emerging field of [*dimension reduction subspace criteria*](https://deriktboonstra.github.io/research/#dimension-reduction-subspace-criteria) which proposes new ways to order and evaluate subspaces beyond traditional eigenvalue-based methods. I am passionate about both teaching and research and aspire to join a university where I can teach and mentor students while continuing to advance statistical methodology.

## More About Me 

I am from [Lufkin, TX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufkin,_Texas) (East TX & north of Houston). I attended [Hudson ISD](https://www.hudsonisd.org), where I met my partner, Paxton. We are high school sweethearts who have been growing through life together ever since. She attended Texas Tech University, where she earned her B.S.N., and is now a certified emergency nurse and has just accomplished obtaining her M.S.N. from Purdue University. I attended Baylor University, where I earned my B.B.A. through the [Business Fellows](https://hankamer.baylor.edu/fellows) program while also majoring in Statistics, Finance, and Accounting. I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Statistical Science and Teacher of Record at Baylor University. We now live together in Waco, TX, with our dog-daughter Khaleesi (Khali for short), who is a smart and beautiful lab mix. We are excited and open to wherever life and opportunities take us next.

My interest in data science and statistics began in high school when I taught myself to day trade stocks. At the time, I was particularly focused on modeling natural gas futures based on weekly market reports, and I now primarily trade high-momentum equities. During my undergraduate studies, I had internships in Accounting and Finance. However, I found my calling in statistics after taking courses in mathematical and computational statistics, which allowed me to see how theoretical ideas from statistics, business, and other fields can be meaningfully applied to real data. With this, my undergraduate honors thesis examined the statistical properties of stock-market data structures by exploring alternatives to traditional time-based sampling, such as sampling by number of transactions or other measures to investigatedhow these different schemes influence machine learning algorithms. Additionally, I had the opportunity to participate in the NSF-funded [MoWater Data Science Fellowship](https://mowater.web.baylor.edu) where my team and I collaborated with environmental engineers from $SENTRY^{TM}$ Water Technologies to analyze sensor-based carbon consumption data for improving wastewater treatment processes. 

This interest in statistics and data science led me to pursue graduate studies at Baylor University, where I earned my M.S. in Statistical Science in 2023 and am now in my final year of Ph.D. candidacy with an expected graduation date of May 2026. My current research primarily focuses on sufficient dimension reduction methodologies and subspace criteria with biomedical applications involving DNA and RNA sequences. Going forward, I plan to continue advancing biomedical research through applications in genomics and brain imaging analysis, while also exploring my roots in business by developing joint dimension reduction and causal estimation methods with applications in econometrics, operations research, and finance.

Aside from statistics, I have a wide range of hobbies. Sportswise, I played basketball growing up but I now enjoy body building and working out with my partner Paxton. Lately, we have been trying (and mostly failing) to learn how to play golf. My mom is a professional baker, so I have always loved cooking and took advanced culinary courses all throughout high school. I primarily enjoy cooking Asian inspired dishes. I also enjoy reading science fiction (a Star Wars kid at heart) and thinking about the implications of the future from a technological and political point of view. Lastly, I love taking long walks with our dog Khali and taking her on trips to satisfy her pup-cup addiction.
