## Welcome!
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Statistical Science and Teacher of Record at Baylor University.  My primary research focuses on developing [*sufficient dimension reduction*](https://deriktboonstra.github.io/research/#sufficient-dimension-reduction) methodologies for high-dimensional data analysis with applications in  [*Genomics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics).  Moreover, I have introduced an emerging field of [*dimension reduction subspace criteria*](https://deriktboonstra.github.io/research/#dimension-deduction-dubspace-criteria) which proposes new ways to order and evaluate subspaces beyond traditional eigenvalue-based methods. I am passionate about both teaching and research and aspire to join a university where I can teach and mentor students while continuing to advance statistical methodology.

## More About Me 

I am from [Lufkin, TX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufkin,_Texas) (East TX & north of Houston). I attended [Hudson ISD](https://www.hudsonisd.org), where I met my partner, Paxton. We are high school sweethearts who have been growing through life together ever since. She attended Texas Tech University, where she earned her B.S.N., and is now a certified emergency nurse and has just accomplished obtaining her M.S.N. from Purdue University. I attended Baylor University, where I earned my B.B.A. through the [Business Fellows](https://hankamer.baylor.edu/fellows) program while also majoring in Statistics, Finance, and Accounting. I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Statistical Science and Teacher of Record at Baylor University. We now live together in Waco, TX, with our dog-daughter Khaleesi (Khali for short), who is a smart and beautiful lab mix. We are excited and open to wherever life and opportunities take us next.
