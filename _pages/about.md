## Welcome!
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Statistical Science and Teacher of Record at Baylor University.  My primary research focuses on developing *sufficient dimension reduction methodologies *for high-dimensional data analysis with an emphasis on Genomics.  Moreover, I have introduced an emerging field of *dimension reduction subspace criteria** which proposes new ways to order and evaluate subspaces beyond traditional eigenvalue-based methods. I am passionate about both teaching and research and aspire to join a university where I can teach and mentor students while continuing to advance statistical methodology.
